# Linefollower-STM32-Hardware
These are some simple Linefollower schematics I did a while ago. It was my first MCU hardware project so I think much could be improved.
It uses 5 CNY70 photocouplers, and two DC motors. For speed control I used L289N and for MCU I chose an STM32F101.
If you would like to share any advices about potential improvements of this project I would love to hear it :D.
